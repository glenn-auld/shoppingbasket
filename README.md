# shoppingbasket

Very basic implementation of a shopping basket which can calculate the total price of all added items.

The basket works with a base type (Item), which is extended by Fruit and a number of concrete fruit classes: Banana, Orange, Apple, Lemon and Peach.
Source code includes some basic unit testing for the calculation of the total cost of the items in the basket.
